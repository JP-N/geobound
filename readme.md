# Welcome to Geobound!

## What it does -
Geobound is a to-do list that **calls you out on laziness**. Users make an account on the website, pick a location on the map, and the associated task to keep them accountable. Whether it's crushing your gym session, immersing yourself in library studies, or ensuring you never miss a class, _Geobound_ has your back.

## Inspiration -
We were brainstorming ideas and we all had the same problem of wanting something to help us stay accountable to our commitments. We thought "what if we made something that could let us tag in to a place and send a reminder message if we don't? Our idea emerged from a collective desire to bridge the gap between intention and action.

## Our Tech Stack -
Our entire server is run on Node.js and Express.js

![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-%23404d59.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=%2361DAFB)

Our front end is built with Bootstrap and Pug

![Bootstrap](https://img.shields.io/badge/bootstrap-%238511FA.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=bootstrap&logoColor=white)

Our database for account management, logging, and storing user info is MongoDB

Our **middleware** for account login and authentication uses Auth0.

An **honorable** shoutout goes to the **Google Maps API** for allowing us to set locations.

## Challenges we ran into - 
We had a few challenges here, nothing that we couldn't overcome, but we're proud to admit that:

• Three out of four members have never used PUG before

• None of us have ever used MongoDB or Auth0 before

• Sleep turned out to be critical

## Accomplishments that we're proud of - 
We are a **proud** team just to be here, and love that we had the opportunity to use different frameworks to bring a full stack project together.

## What we learned - 
We learned that what the tech world calls "Integration Hell" is a _very_ real thing. 

## What's next for Geobound
- [ ] Text and Email reminders
- [ ] Cookies and saved logins
- [ ] Potentially an App Store or Play Store app
